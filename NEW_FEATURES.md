# 🚀 New Enhanced Features

## 📋 Summary of Changes

Your Hilal's Smart Dating Bot has been enhanced with intelligent automation features that solve common issues with Tinder bots getting stuck or running out of matches.

## 🔧 Key Problems Solved

### 1. **"Out of Matches" Detection** 🚫
**Problem**: Bot would get stuck when Tinder shows "We've run out of potential matches in your area"
**Solution**: Smart detection of this message with automatic location changing

### 2. **Like Button Availability** 👍
**Problem**: Bot continued clicking even when no like button was present
**Solution**: Smart detection that only clicks when button is actually available

### 3. **Automatic Location Changing** 🌍
**Problem**: Manual location changes were tedious and error-prone
**Solution**: Fully automated location changing with 6-step process

### 4. **Popup Handling** 🔧
**Problem**: "Upgrade Your Like" popups would interrupt swiping
**Solution**: Automatic detection and dismissal of upgrade popups

## 🆕 New Features Implemented

# New method in GeomatchHelper
stats = geomatch_helper.smart_swipe_session(cities, swipes_per_city)

## 🔍 Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced GeomatchHelper Class
```python
class GeomatchHelper:
    def check_out_of_matches(self) -> bool

    def dismiss_upgrade_popup(self) -> bool

"//a[@title='My Profile' and @href='/app/profile']"

# Location settings
"//a[@aria-label='Location' and contains(@href, '/app/settings/plus/passport')]"

# Location search
"//input[@aria-label='Search a Location' and @placeholder='Search a Location']"

# Location marker
"//div[contains(@class, 'passport__locationMarker')]"

# No Thanks button
"//button[.//div[contains(@class, 'lxn9zzn') and contains(text(), 'No Thanks')]]"

# Smart like button
"//button[contains(@class, 'gamepad-button') and .//span[text()='Like']]"
```
